4 - Start a new game of bowling
5 - There only needs to be one active game at a time
6 - Bowl one frame and return the result.

8 - The result of each roll (note that most frames can have either 1 or 2 rolls, but the final frame can have up to 3)
9 - The result of the frame (a score of 0-9, a spare, or a strike)
10 - The result should be randomly generated

13 - If the first frame rolls were 3 and 5 and the second frame was a spare, the current score is 8
14 - If the first frame was a spare and the second frame a strike, the current score is 0
15 - If the first frame was a strike and the second frame rolls were 2 and 7, the current score is 28
